    "## Problem 1\n",
    "The hardest part of working with an API is finding and understanding the API's documentation. While the documentation (if it exists!) is essential for helping you to navigate to the data you need, they are also dense and technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "One big reason why API documentation is difficult is that it has to speak to all use-cases. Very often, when software engineers interact with an API like genius.com's, they are building apps. Imagine that you are hired to build an events and ticketing app for a local music venue. You might want to embed a list of albums, songs, and background information in your app by connecting to the Genius API (for song lyrics and artist information) and pulling that data into your app. You might run a record label and you want to interact with this API by posting information about the musicians you've signed. Or you might want to collect data on the users of genius.com for marketing research. The documentation must provide enough information to support all of these uses. As a result, documentation tends to be very long, and most of the information you will see is neither relevant nor easy to understand. That is okay, and should be the expectation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively use API documentation, take a deep breath. Then narrow your search through the documentation to only these four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **The root**: We make requests from an API by, in part, writing out a complicated URL. In Python, we will compile the segments of this URL and let the `requests` package build the right URL. The first segment is the root, or the shared beginning of every URL associated with this API. Roots sometimes also include a version number such as /v2 or /v3. Your first task is to find the root and save it as a string in Python. One complaint I have about API documentation is that sometimes the root is a bit difficult to find, whereas I think it should be written in bold letters on the homepage. Sometimes I have to look for *example calls* to the API to see the root being used. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The endpoints**: The next part of an API call's URL (generally after the first slash / but before the question mark) is called the endpoint. Very commonly, APIs have many endpoints for many different types of data. Genius for example has separate endpoints for songs, artists, user accounts, its search engine, and other types of functions. Sometimes endpoints are called \"resources\" or something similar, but you can generally tell an endpoint because it is denoted with a slash first, such as Genius's /songs, /artists, /accounts, and /search sections under resources. Your task here is to find the endpoint or endpoints that can give you the data you need by reading their descriptions in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The endpoint parameters**: Some endpoints will also have a list of parameters that control the selection of data a request will return. There are two ways that these parameters can appear in an API call's URL. First, they can appear as \"query parameters\" after a question mark, using equal signs to specify parameter values, and separating parameters with & signs. If you write these parameters in a dictionary and use the `params` argument in the `requests.get()` method to supply these parameters to the API, then `requests` will format the URL properly for you. The other way parameters might appear is as \"path parameters\" which are part of the endpoint, sometimes surrounded by {curly braces}: this format implies that the parameter value should be part of the endpoint you supply to `requests.get()` instead of an entry in the `params` argument. Either way, your task here is to find the parameters that enable you to get the data you need and to use the correct names and values of these parameters in your Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How to acquire API authentication or access keys, and how to supply these credentials when interacting with the API**: It's important to remember that APIs are designed to give the data owners control over how their data is shared with users like you. There is a political dimension to that: a data owner can choose what to divulge or keep private. There's also a financial dimension: websites can charge you at varying rates for using the API, can restrict the speed and volume of your requests to prevent you from overloading systems or profiting too much off of their work, or can use a \"freemium\" model where only a small amount of data is free but more data carries charges. Many APIs require you to register in advance and acquire secret codes (called keys or tokens) that must be supplied back to the API to enable your use. You have two tasks here. First you need to find instructions in the documentation for acquiring API access keys, paying particular attention to whether they are asking for a credit card (Genius does not) and if so what they might charge you, and what limits exist on the amount of data you can grab. Second, you need to find the instructions for supplying your key to the API. Sometimes that will be one of the endpoint parameters, and sometimes it will be in the headers along with your user-agent string. (When providing an API key via the headers, there's a common format that requires you to write the word \"Bearer\" and a space before your key. You are likely to see this format pop up sometimes.) \n",
    "\n",
    "For the following problems, describe in words how you can get the data in question. Use the API documentation linked in each question. Be specific about \n",
    "\n",
    "* the root, \n",
    "* endpoint, \n",
    "* parameters, \n",
    "* method of acquiring keys, \n",
    "* method for supplying these keys during an API call,\n",
    "* and whether and how using the API costs money, or is limited to only certain quantities of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is more than one way to accomplish a task, describing just one of the valid approaches is fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do not write Python code to accomplish these steps. Focus on reading the documentation and understanding what you would need to do if you did attempt to get the data. Also, do NOT give any of these websites a credit card or other payment information, and please do not copy and paste your API keys into this document."
